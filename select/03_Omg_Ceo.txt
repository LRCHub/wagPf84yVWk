Just breathing, breathing, left no space
Find the ways to lift me out this maze
Just a rookie and its rollercoaster ways
Never thought soon, someday I would float
Inside a grace of life, shes like O
Favorites sound silly O
And this summations swallow blood, colors the sun
Just keep it pure, keep it down in deeper way
You can ride your life and shes like O
Baby boy, Im your realest fan
See, Im like wham, bam, thank you, mam
And she like, stuttering
Yep, shes like damn
I keep on falling for the same old scam
See, Im like I guess its all part of your master plan
And she like, the sounds are sure but keep them fluttering
Take me now, lets go forever
Just take a bow and get on my level
Take the vow, just the fear, let it fly
Take me now, lets go forever
Just take a bow, we in this together
Like bow wow wow, its the sins, let them fly
Now or never
