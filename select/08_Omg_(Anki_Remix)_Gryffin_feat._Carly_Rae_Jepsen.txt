No chemical can recreate our chemistry
Got what I need, need, need
I'm technical but I love sensibility
When you're next to me
I feel the boom, feel the bang inside my soul, love
When you lay me down
When you do it that way, I lose control love
Of my senses now

You got me flying and falling till four in the morning
Can you hear my body is calling your name?

Like oh my god (ooh), I think I might love you
'Cause I only liked a lot of things before I knew
The way I love it when you touch me now
Oh my god (ooh), I think I might love you-oo-ooh
'Cause I only liked a lot of things before I knew
The way I love it when you touch me now (ooh)

Oh my god (ooh)
The way I love it when you touch me now
Oh my god (ooh), I think I might love you-oo-ooh
'Cause I only liked a lot of things before I knew
The way I love it when you touch me now

I go from zero to a million when you dim the lights
You get me high, high, high
When you whisper in my ear I hear a lullaby
So sing to me all night
I feel the boom, feel the bang from head to toe, love
When you caress me down
When you do it that way, I lose control love
You know you got me now

You got me flying and falling till four in the morning
Can you hear my body is calling your name?

Like oh my god (ooh), I think I might love you
'Cause I only liked a lot things before I knew
The way I love it when you touch me now
Oh my god (ooh), I think I might love you-oo-ooh
'Cause I only liked a lot things before I knew
The way I love it when you touch me now (ooh)

Oh my god (ooh)
The way I love it when you touch me now
Oh my god (ooh), I think I might love you-oo-ooh
'Cause I only liked a lot of things before I knew
The way I love it when you touch me now

You got me flying and falling till four in the morning
Can you hear my body is calling your name?
And when you're gone you should know that you're all that I'm wanting
And I'll always be feeling the same

Like oh my god (ooh), I think I might love you
'Cause I only liked a lot of things before I knew
The way I love it when you touch me now
Oh my god (ooh), I think I might love you (ahh)
'Cause I only liked a lot of things before I knew
The way I love it when you touch me now

Oh my god (I think I might love you)
Oh my god (ooh)
The way I love it when you touch me now
Oh my god (ooh)
I think I might love you-oo-ooh (I think I might love you)
'Cause I only liked a lot of things before I knew
The way I love it when you touch me now
