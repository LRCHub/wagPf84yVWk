No chemical could recreate our chemistry
Got what I need need need
I'm technical but I lose sensibility
When you're next to me
I feel a boom feel a bang
Inside my soul love
When you lay me down
When you do it that way I lose control
Of all my senses now

You got me flying and flooring
Till 4 in the morning
Can you hear my body is calling your name

Like oh my god (ooh)
I think I might love you
Cause I only liked a lot of things before I knew
The way I love it when you touch me now

Oh my god (ooh)
I think I might love you
Cause I only liked a lot of things before I knew
The way I love it when you touch me now

(Oh my god ooh, the way I love it when you touch me now)

Oh my god ooh, I think I might love you
Cause I only liked a lot of things before I knew
The way I love it when you touch me now

I go from zero to a million when you dim the lights
You get me high high high
When you whisper in my ear I hear a lullaby
So sing to me all night
I feel the boom feel the bang
From head to toe love
When you caress me down
When you do it that way
I lose control love
You know you got me now

You got me flying and flooring
Till 4 in the morning
Can you hear My body is calling your name

Like oh my god (ooh)
I think I might love you
Cause I only liked a lot of things before I knew
The way I love it when you touch me now

Oh my god (ooh)
I think I might love you
Cause I only liked a lot of things before I knew
The way I love it when you touch me now

(Oh my god ooh, the way I love it when you touch me now)

Oh my god ooh, I think I might love you
Cause I only liked a lot of things before I knew
The way I love it when you touch me now

You got me flying and flooring
Till 4 in the morning
Can you hear my body is calling your name

And when you're gone you should know that you're all that I'm wanting

And I'll always be feeling the same

Like oh my god (ooh)
I think I might love you
Cause I only liked a lot of things before I knew
The way I love it when you touch me now

Oh my god (ooh)
I think I might love you
Cause I only liked a lot of things before I knew
The way I love it when you touch me now

(Oh my god, I think I might love you)
(Oh my god ooh, the way I love it when you touch me now)

Oh my god ooh, I think I might love you
Cause I only liked a lot of things before I knew
The way I love it when you touch me now
