-BECAUSE LOVE-
You came into my world as a guest.
You got out of my life so fast.
Now, my feelings are lost.
I call you in my dreams most.
Because, love is a madness.
Because, love is a madness.
The wind blurred me like a bum.
This love has become a tedium.
My ideas and I became quantum.
I want these thoughts to a minumum.
Because, love is a black hole.
Because, love is a black hole.
Finally the voice of the God within me warned me.
Be patient and go resume.
I said strenght gimme.
The bottomless well became ocean me.
Because, love is a believe.
Because, love is a believe.
I thought like Robinson who fell on the island.
I want my prejudices here paper like bend.
Seeing your beautiful face again changed my mind.
I will love you to the end.
Because, love is a eternity.
Because, love is a eternity.
